# Geogebra-App
 This is a simple graphical user interface (GUI) tool built with Python and the Matplotlib library that allows users to draw and manipulate basic shapes on a two-dimensional XY plane, similar to the popular math software GeoGebra. Users can draw points, lines, circles, and polygons, move them around, and delete them. The tool also displays the equations and coordinates of each shape and updates them in real-time as the shapes are manipulated. The GUI is built using the Tkinter library and includes a side panel for displaying shape information and a menu bar for saving and loading drawings.

Installation: To run the tool, you need Python 3.x and the Matplotlib and Tkinter libraries installed on your machine. Clone the repository, navigate to the root directory, and run the ui.py file to launch the GUI.

Usage: Upon launching the GUI, you will see an empty XY plane with buttons for drawing points, lines, circles, and polygons on the left-hand side. Clicking on a shape will highlight it, and you can move it around by clicking and dragging it with your mouse. To delete a shape, right-click on it. The side panel displays the coordinates and equations of the selected shape, and you can use the menu bar to save and load drawings as .txt files.

Contributing: If you would like to contribute to the project, feel free to fork the repository and make your changes. Please submit a pull request with a description of your changes and why you think they would be a valuable addition to the tool.
